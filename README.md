#What?

If you're too lazy to open google calendar, you can see the next 10 events on a list of calendars.

#How?

You need to set everything up with Google and get the credentials in a file.

You'll also need to tell google that you're deving on the calendar (I forget how.)

Then you can run this. You need to provide calendar ids as a file cal-ids.txt in your home directory. It should list all the calendar id's line-by-line.
